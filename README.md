# Prediction---Movie-Revenue-and-Rating

Based on a university assignment (and classic ML intro task) asking us to predict a movie's revenue (regression) and rating (classification) based on a dataset including name, cast, crew, production company etc. Data is in .csv format with training and validation datasets split (the test dataset was used for final grading). Program outputs a prediction of revenue and rating for each film into a .csv file. A walkthrough is included explaining steps taken at each stage and reasoning.
